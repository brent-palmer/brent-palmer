		          	<label>1. Discovery</label>
		            <p>I start by consolidating all available project documentation and schedule workshops with your team. During those sessions, I interview stakeholders, collaborate on requirements, ideate, and plan the next steps. When possible, I talk to your current or potential customers to understand their needs and pain points. I will also review competitor products, gather visual design references, and document best practices.</p>
		            <label>2. Definition</label>
		            <p>Based on the discovery and research results, I synthesize a digital strategy and define a UX approach that drives the rest of the project. I craft a crisp set of user needs (JTBD) and work with product teams to establish KPIs for success. I conduct user interviews to validate the strategy before a line of code is written. This ensures we’re building something viable.</p>
		            <label>3. Execution</label>
		            <p>I then move into delivery mode by producing interactive prototypes, user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity UIs. I pair with developers in the environment of choice to get the fit and finish right, continuously conducting user tests and iterating along the way.</p>
		            <label>4. Phased release</label>
		            <p>I work with Engineering teams to feature flag solutions to affected groups. Tools like FullStory and HotJar are incredibly beneficial in studying new feature adoption. I compile a list of improvements based on new insights. Rinse and repeat.</p>
